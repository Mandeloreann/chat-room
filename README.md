# Whispers: A Chat App
Whispers is a instant messaging app users may use by creating an
account and signing in. Through the use of socket.io and its web
sockets, users can chat in real time using the public channel.
With the use of our express back-end application, messages are
created and stored on a database made with MongoDB. Back-end
routes communicate with the front end to allow users to create,
update, read, and delete messages. Through token authentication
users can only delete and update messages which they own.

## Technologies Used
Socket.io, JavaScript, SCSS/CSS, HTML, ATOM, VS Code, MongoDB, React,
GitHib, and ZenHub.

## The Future of Whispers:
In future iterations of Whispers, the dev team hopes to add
the ability for users to create and delete channels to create
specific communities. We would also like to add show/hide
functionality to the udpate message field so chat indicies will
not be crowded with empty forms.

## Development Process
First, the team created wireframes and user stories in order to
plan the process out properly. We then each split off to work on
styling, user authentication, CRUD for user messages, and sockets.
Three times a day we met to debug and merge branches. Combined with
these stand-ups, we also mob programmed any time we ran into
significant roadblocks or were needing to work on the same files.
